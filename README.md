Before start:
Need to download the Tensor Toolbox from https://www.tensortoolbox.org/

Code:
⁃	`FSSM_norm.m, FAR_norm.m, FARMA_norm.m `: to investigate the predictive performance of Settings (I-III) (experimental results in Section VI-B1 and VI-B2)
	⁃	`FSSM_online.m`: to compare EM and online EM (experimental results in Section VI-B3)
	⁃	`FSSM_convergence.m`: to conduct convergence analysis (experimental results in Section VI-B4)
